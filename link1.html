  <h1 class="issues-title" align="center" >Issues Turkish Women Are Facing</h1>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">In Turkey, women are facing a number of related problems, including high rates of femicide and gender-based violence. Issues like low labor force participation and wage gaps are worsened by a lack of childcare and unstructured work. Women in Turkey are struggling with a lack of representation in politics and decision-making. Educational barriers and pressure for early marriage still persist in some areas. Limited access to safe abortion despite legal allowances and widespread online harassment are other challenges Turkish women continue to encounter.</p>
  <img id="centered" src="images/international women's day.jpg" alt="protest">

  <h1 class="gender-based">Gender-Based Violence</h1>
    <p>Gender-based violence continues to be a critical and profoundly concerning issue, affecting women across different demographics, from little girls to women with varying socioeconomic backgrounds, throughout Turkey.</p>
    <p>In an act to combat violence against women, the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence, commonly known as the Istanbul Convention, was adopted by the Committee of Ministers and opened for signature in Istanbul on May 11, 2011. Turkey was the first nation to ratify. It officially entered into force on August 1, 2014. The Convention recognizes gender-based violence against women as both a human rights violation and a form of discrimination. It requires State Parties to implement legal and practical measures to prevent violence, protect victims, and prosecute offenders. This was a historic step towards a transformational change by tackling gender-based violence through legal and institutional reform.</p>
    <p>The Convention aimed to prevent violence, protect victims, prosecute perpetrators, and promote policy coordination by focusing on public services. The Convention placed a strong emphasis on education, raising public awareness, and promoting gender equality as key strategies in preventing violence against women and domestic violence. It ensured everyone’s access to adequate information on support services, established accessible shelters, providing 24/7 telephone support services, and legal assistance as essential measures to ensure the protection and support of victims. It also aimed to prosecute perpetrators through specific legislation and enhanced enforcement. Throughout these years, there were transformational changes in these areas, such as increased investment in shelters and hotlines for women and the enforcement of several laws (2012 Law to Protect Family and Prevent Violence Against Women - Law No. 6284). A change occurred. Courts began issuing protection orders more frequently, and local authorities were held more accountable and educated to address these situations. Police officers received clear instructions on how to respond to domestic violence calls. Although the Convention actively worked to create a social change and advocated for reform, weak enforcement at both the police and judicial levels and ingrained cultural norms and gender stereotypes limited its effectiveness and comprised the implementation of its policies. </p>
    <p>Turkey withdrew from the Istanbul Convention on March 20, 2021, marking a significant setback in its efforts to combat gender-based violence and protection of women's rights. The Turkish government's reasoning for this act was the Convention contradicted the country's family values and promoted LGBTQ+ rights, which opposed Turkey's social and religious norms.</p>
    <p>Since then, there have been increased reports of femicides and domestic violence incidents. In 2021, a horrendous case of femicide occurred again following Turkey's withdrawal. Activists argue that Turkey's withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention symbolized the abandonment and neglect of women's safety. On November 9, Başak Cengiz, a 28-year-old architect, was brutally attacked in broad daylight in Istanbul’s Ataşehir district. While she was walking down the street, a man possessing a samurai sword approached her from behind, assaulting her and stabbing her repeatedly without provocation, even after she collapsed on the sidewalk. Unfortunately, she did not survive. Cengiz was a promising architect who moved from Ankara to Istanbul to pursue opportunities in her career and was engaged to be married. During the police interrogation, the suspect confessed he did it. His reasoning was alarming. He revealed he went in search of someone to kill and chose a woman because "it would be easier," he said.</p>
    <p>A report drafted by a women’s rights organization titled “At least 394 Women Were Killed by Men in 2024, and 259 Were Found Dead in Suspicious Circumstances,” revealed 2024 as a historic surge in femicides, reaching the highest levels since collecting data. A particular year femicides declined over the past 14 years was 2011 – the year Turkey signed the Istanbul Convention. As public debates and controversy surrounding the Convention became more vocalized, femicides and suspicious deaths have increased. One of the primary factors contributing to the rising rate of femicides is the continuing policy of impunity, which shields perpetrators from accountability. Political authorities prioritize “family shops” rather than implementing and enforcing effective measures. In 2024 alone, 280 women were murdered by men close to them – fathers, husbands, sons, or other relatives. Across these reported cases, 19 girls were killed by their fathers, and in 9 incidents, the mother and daughter were murdered. On 20 occasions in which women were murdered, the women had active protection orders at the time.</p>
  
  <h1 class="education-employment">Education and Employment</h1>
    <p>After gaining independence from the Ottoman Empire, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk became the first president of the newly founded Turkey Republic in 1923, leading the country to various transformative reforms. Under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Turkey Republic was heading in a different direction to secularize and advance as a society. In 1924, the Law on Unification of Education established a secularized and unified education system under the government’s control for all children, regardless of gender. This granted girls access to education. Girls began enrolling in schools rapidly. However, social, cultural, and economic barriers limited girls’ access to education, especially in rural areas where education was unrewarded and underappreciated. It was common for low-income people in these areas to be illiterate. As for cultural and social aspects, the patriarchal social norms expected girls to carry out domestic tasks, helping their parents in the farm, and obey their fathers, brothers, and eventually their husbands. In many cases, early marriages prevented many girls from receiving an education.</p>
    <p>According to 2022 data from the World Bank Group, 92.4% of girls and boys in Turkey complete lower secondary school, similar to the average rate within Europe and Central Asia. Literacy levels among men and women are high. Literacy is defined by the ability of individuals of ages15 or above to “read and write with understanding a short simple statement about their everyday life.” However, a gender gap in adult literacy remains. While nearly 99% of men are literate, it is around 94% of women, reflecting a disparity in educational access and opportunities. </p>
    <p>In the same study, the labor force participate is defined as the “proportion of the population ages 15 and above that is economically active”. Despite the social and economic changes over time, the labor force for women has remained roughly the same since 1990. As of 2023, there is a significant gender gap in the work force. Only 35.8% of women participate in the labor force, compared to 71.1% of men. Workers in vulnerable employment are individuals with limited access to formal work arrangements, social protection, and economic safety nets. Therefore, they are at a higher risk of falling into poverty. About 25.8% of women and 23.1% of men are in a position of vulnerable employment. Although these rates are higher than other regional averages for Europe and Central Asia, indicating job insecurity and informal working conditions are much higher in Turkey compared to other regions. </p>
    <p>Current challenges women face are related to traditional gender roles, discrimination, and lack of childcare. Cultural expectations assign women as the primary caretaker and domestic tasks. According to the data from World Bank, women spent roughly 19.2% of their day performing unpaid work in 2015, whereas men spent 3.7% of their day on unpaid work. The data measures the average amount of time individuals spend on household tasks and caregiving for their own household. The data gathered from the most recent data point between 2014 and 2024 shows societal and economic inequalities that limit women’s participation in the labor market, and economic growth and independence. Women also encounter prejudice in the work force and labor market, as it is more difficult for women to secure employment or be promoted, compared to men. Women are also paid much less than their male counterparts. Due to the insufficient childcare services and inflexible hours, women who are mothers and part of the work force find difficulties in balancing both, feeling obligated to choose one. </p>

  <h1 class="politics-leadership">Women in Politics and Leadership</h1>
    <p>To fully comprehend the importance of women's suffrage in Turkey, it is crucial to discuss the historical context that continues to influence the present day or has since evolved.</p>

    <strong>The Ottoman Period (Before 2923)</strong>
    <p>Before the Turkish Republic in 1923, the Ottoman Empire upheld traditional gender roles, which excluded women from any political participation. The Ottoman Empire's legal system was built around Islamic law (Sharia). It did not allow women the right to participate in politics, as their role was solely confined to domestic and family matters.</p>

    <strong>Turkey</strong>
    <p>Women in Turkey gained the right to vote in municipal election until 1930 and in national elections in 1934. This was granted by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk who aimed to transform Turkey into a progressive and modernized nation. A significant year, 1935, when 18 women were elected to the Grand National Assembly. However, women’s participation in politics has decreased with low representation and limited influence. In municipal governments, men are the majority, while women leaders only make up a small percentage.  Similarly to the issues with education and employment, women in politics face lack of institutional support and patriarchal society, especially in a highly male centric profession like politics. Additionally, as public figures, women face sexist comments, and media bias and harassment. As of 2022, one out of 17 government ministers in Turkey is a woman, and women make up about 17.38% of the member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, falling below the global average of 25.5%. Underrepresentation of women is much lower in local governments. It reflects the barriers women face that limit their participation in politics.</p>

  <h1 class="harassment">Harassment</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the growth of deeply harmful behaviors particularly against women and girls is known as gendered digital violence. Online harassment takes on specific forms by using technology to control, intimidate, and humiliate women and girls. It includes cyberstalking, controlling a partner’s social media account, recording and sharing images or audio without consent, altering or misusing personal images, and publishing private information without permission. </p>
    <p>Common Knowledge and Communication Association and KONDA Research company conducted a survey with over 3,000 respondents in May 2021 to analyze digital violence. Research indicates about one in five people in Turkey suffer digital violence. The most mentioned social media platform among survey participants were Instagram (53%), Facebook (35%). AND Twitter (19%). Within youth, one in five people from ages 15 to 17 and one in three from ages 18 to 32 experience digital violence. However, the reasoning is distinct. In cases for women, it differs significantly from men. While both genders experience digital violence, the type of violence is related to their gender (52%) and physical appearance (21%). </p>

  <h1 class="abortion-rights">Abortion Rights</h1>
    <p>Abortion has been legal since 1983, which allows women to seek an abortion on a request up to 10 weeks of pregnancy, and in some cases such as threatening women’s physical or mental health, it can extend up to 20 weeks. Despite its legal status, the stigma surrounding abortions is shame and disgrace for women who seek abortions. Women face various obstacles that prevents abortions, such as the refusal of care by healthcare providers and ways to finance, as the cost is very high. </p>
    <p>In 2016, Kadir Has University conducted research on abortion, which indicated there is a de-facto abortion ban in Turkey. The numbers are shocking. Only 7.8% of hospitals with departments of obstetrics and gynecology provide abortion services with no restrictions, 78% provide abortion care if it is medically necessary, and 11.8% provide no care at all. The President Erdoğan made remarks against abortions, as he believes “abortion is murder… a woman denying motherhood is only half a woman.”</p>
    <p>However, organizations such as Women for Women’s Human Rights and Mor Çatı Women's Shelter Foundation are actively working to help women in Turkey by providing access to information and resources to abortion rights and services. </p>
