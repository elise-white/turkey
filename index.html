      <h4><b>Issues Turkish Women Are Facing</b></h4> 
      <p>In Turkey, women are facing a number of related problems, including high rates of femicide and gender-based violence. Issues like low labor force participation and wage gaps are worsened by a lack of childcare and unstructured work. Women in Turkey are struggling with a lack of representation in politics and decision-making. Educational barriers and pressure for early marriage still persist in some areas. Limited access to safe abortion despite legal allowances and widespread online harassment are other challenges Turkish women continue to encounter. These issues particularly impact Turkish women, adding discrimination to their already difficult struggles for safety, freedom, and equal opportunity.

      <h4><b>UN Sustainability Goal For Turkish Women</b></h4> 
      <p>The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls is the one that Turkish women are most directly concerned with. Turkey's achievement of this objective depends on five critical areas. The achievement of this goal in Turkey depends on five key fronts: Firstly, implementing policies and services that prevent femicide and gender-based violence. Secondly, reducing economic disparities by increasing women's employment, particularly in STEM jobs, and providing equal compensation. Thirdly, ensuring universal access to quality childcare, reproductive health care, and digital skills so women can work, study, and lead in a safe manner. Fourthly, increasing the representation of women in parliament, local governments, and corporate boards through regulations and leadership programs. Lastly, addressing the special needs of Kurdish, refugee, rural, disabled, and LGBTQ+ women to ensure no group is left behind.

        <h4><b>Legal Reforms To Safeguard Turkish Women</b></h4> 
        <p>The majority of the legal laws required to safeguard women are already in the hands of Turkish politicians, however, some problems continue to prevail. Despite introducing the necessary laws to support women, Law No. 6284 has presented significant problems with execution. Effective risk evaluations and surveillance are lacking, and courts have the authority to impose cautionary orders for brief periods. Those who break the orders might not be properly punished. Women have been killed in extreme situations despite knowing the dangers, and the precautions taken were unsuccessful. The Ministry of Family and Social Services' Violence Prevention and Monitoring Centers seek to be a key player in fighting domestic abuse. These facilities were set up to monitor protective orders, improve coordination between the police, courts, and social services, and offer services like risk assessment, shelter placement, and ongoing victim assistance.

        <h4><b>Organizational Approaches For Womens Rights In Turkey </b></h4> 
        <p>Women's NGOs have become increasingly influential in gender politics in Turkey, particularly after the country's shift to capitalism. Turkish women’s rights work is driven mostly by civil society organizations that combine campaigning, direct assistance, and data‑based advocacy. While WWHR–New Ways combines basic human rights education with legislative influencing and international network-building, established NGOs like the Mor Çatı Women’s Shelter Foundation run shelters, legal clinics, and nationwide training for social workers and lawyers. Even as they oppose closure suits filed by authorities, activist groups such as the We Will Stop Femicide Platform (KCDP) participate in public femicide demonstrations, keep an open femicide database, and advocate for more severe punishments. Together, these groups serve as the backbone for Turkish women, recording acts of abuse, assisting survivors, and exerting pressure on the government to uphold Law 6284 and reestablish Istanbul Convention norms.
