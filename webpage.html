                <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> First laws for women's rights in Turkey were introduced in the early years of the Republic under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. 1926 was a big year. The Turkish Civil Code was adopted. It was modelled after the Swiss Civil Code. Islamic Sharia law was replaced with secular law and women got many rights, divorce, inheritance, custody etc. Polygamy was abolished, civil marriage was made mandatory. These reforms are the foundation of gender equality in modern Turkey and were the most advanced in the region at that time. Turkey ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1985. This action was an important step in adjusting national laws to meet international human rights standards. The pledge resulted in several law changes during the 1990s. These changes sought to improve women's rights, especially when domestic violence occurred. Amendments to the Penal Code were part of this. The government set up protective actions for those who survived abuse. The government started to give importance to women's safety and legal fairness by defining gender-based violence as a social problem, instead of a personal one. Because of this later changes were possible in the 2000s. This indicated continued government work to establish gender justice as a standard practice.
                 
                    The 1998 "Protection of the Family Act” (Law No. 4320) was a big deal in Turkey, the state's first attempt to address domestic violence through law. This law was to protect women, especially wives, who were being physically, emotionally, or sexually abused by their husbands. Women could apply to family courts for protection orders, and judges could issue restraining orders against abusive husbands, including orders for the offender to leave the home, not to contact, or to surrender weapons. Although it was a big step forward in acknowledging domestic violence as a public issue, not a private family matter, the implementation was limited in the beginning. It only applied to officially married couples, and there was no mechanism for enforcement and support services like shelters or counseling. But it paved the way for further reforms in Turkey's legal system, especially the 2012 Law No. 6284, which expanded the protections and services for all victims of gender based violence.
                     Turkey, in collaboration with many European countries, drafted and signed the Istanbul Convention in 2011, an unprecedented international treaty centered on the prevention of and fighting against violence against women and domestic violence. The Convention not only demanded strict legal measures against offenders but also emphasized preventive education, victim support services, and gender-sensitive measures to address the incidence of gender-based violence. It was the first legally binding instrument providing for a comprehensive framework for the protection of women and promotion of gender equality in all walks of life. In Turkey, women's rights in the Republic have developed since 1923, with international commitments backing them. However, societal gender biases still interrupt the full realization of women's rights in practice, with the applicability of protective laws and access to support services being other concerning issues.</p>

                <h3 align="center">Laws that have changed overtime </h3>
                <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> On 20 March 2021, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, President of Turkey, issued a presidential decree to withdraw Turkey from the Istanbul Convention a move many in Turkey have called unconstitutional. Turkey is the only country in the Council of Europe to have withdrawn from an international human rights treaty. 34 of the 47 Council of Europe countries have signed and ratified the Istanbul Convention. The Turkish government and its allies have said the Convention “threatens family values” and “normalises homosexuality”, claims also made by several governments, including Poland and Hungary, to justify their rollback of rights. The withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention also puts Law No. 6284 at risk of not being followed through. The purpose of this law is to protect the women, the children, the family members, and the victims of stalking, who have been subject to the violence or are at risk of violence, and to regulate procedures and principles about the measures of preventing violence against those people. Many women have pointed out that police officer are not taking their claims seriously after the withdrawal.</p>

                <h3 align="center">How those changes affect women in Turkey today</h3>
                <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> On 1 July 2021, the effective date of Turkey's withdrawal from the Convention was also known when thousands of people took to the streets to protest. Although President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stated that the withdrawal from the international treaty protecting women from violence, is not a step backward for women. It can be taken as that because only in 2020 the year prior there were "Of the 300 women killed in 2020, 97 were killed by their husbands, 54 by their partners, 38 by someone they knew, 21 by their ex-husbands, 18 by their sons, 17 by their fathers, 16 by their relatives, 8 by their ex-partners, 5 by their brothers, and 3 by someone they did not know. The relationship of the people who caused the deaths of 23 women could not be determined." the data is provided by

The platform is dedicated to ending femicide and championing the protection of all women against violence. It stands firm against every single violation of women's rights, beginning with the fundamental right to life. This decision was not taken lightly by the women of Turkey, especially knowing that many resources were being cut and felt that their President had taken a step backward knowing that the convention's emphasis on prevention, protection, criminal prosecution, and policy coordination, along with its focus on identifying gender-based violence, plays a vital role in safeguarding women in Turkey. </p>
