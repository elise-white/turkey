    <hr>
    <p align="left">In Turkey, women's rights groups have adopted a variety of strategies influenced by social, political, and historical factors. The secular, Turkey's president's Kemalist framework, that some groups work within has long placed a strong emphasis on women's liberation as part of modernization. These groups, which focus on education, civic engagement, and gender equality in public life, frequently advocate through legislative changes and policy lobbying. They also collaborate effectively with governmental institutions. They frequently link themselves with major political topics and promote structural transformation through governmental institutions.</p>

    <p>There are other numerous organizations in Turkey which use a variety of strategies to promote women's rights, emphasizing social services, education, legal advocacy, and cultural change. </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>The independent NGO Women For Women's Human Rights (WWHR) is committed to advancing gender equality and women's human rights. To promote legal reforms and increase awareness, it implements initiatives like the Human Rights Education Program for Women (HREP). WWHR works with local community centers to offer easily accessible human rights education for women.</li>

        <li>The Mor Cati Women's Shelter Foundation offers refuge and assistance to women and children who are victims of domestic abuse. Founded in 1990, Mor Cati also advocates for legislative protections like Law No. 6284, Law on the Protection of the Family and Prevention of Violence against Women, and challenges social conventions. Campaigns for public education are another way that Mor Cati challenges social norms that support gender-based violence.</li>

        <li>The feminist group Flying Broom (Uçan Süpürge) is well-known for its yearly International Women's Film Festival. They advocate for gender equality and have influenced legislative changes, including the 2005 revision to the Turkish penal code, which identifies violent crimes against women as crimes against the person rather than societal property.</li>

        <li>EVKAD (Housewives Solidarity and Development Association), which was founded in 1994, offers training programs for those interested in entrepreneurship in an effort to economically empower women. More women can now access resources and find work possibilities because of the association's improved digital capabilities, which were made possible by UN Women's assistance.</li>
